<h1>What is a Graph</h1>
<p>So recently, in one of my mock interviews, I was asked a question that related to graphs. I realized how little I knew about the graph thery...so this is my attempt at a very short exlanaition of what I understand about graphs</p>
<p>A graph is a set of objects, where each object is composed of nodes(vertices), and edges(lines). Each edge in a graph
joins to set of nodes. </br>
More formally, we define a graph G as an ordered pair G = (V,E) where 
V is a set of nodes (vertices).
E is a set of edges (links).
Each edge is a pair of vertices. In other words, each element of E is a pair of elements of V.
</p>
<p>See Below for what a graph looks like</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Vertex={1,2,3,4,5,6}</li>
  <li>Edges={{1,2},{1,5},{2,3},{2,5},{3,4},{4,5},{4,6}}</li>
  <li>G=(V,E)</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Unidirected and Directed Graphs</h4>
<img src="http://webwhompers.com/images/three-node%20networks.jpg">
<p>The main difference between the two is the edges. In a unidirected graph the edge from {2,3} is the same as the edge from {3,2}, while in a directed graph {2,3}, the edge is distinct, from {3,2} edge.</p>
<p>Both in unidirected and directed graphs a path is always defined as a ordered list of directed edges:  P = ((v1,v2),(v2,v3),...,(vk,vk+1)). </p>
<p>Two main things in graph traversal are paths, and trails. A path is a trail in which all vertices (except possibly the first and last) are distinct. A trail is a walk in which all edges are distinct.</p>
<p>There are several algorithms that can find the optimal path in graphs..more about them in the next post.</p>
