	<title>Nine years in San Francisco</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Nine years and counting...</h2>
  <p>Last July, we completed our ninth year of living in San Francisco, though I didn't live in SF for all those nine years, there was the year and half in South America, a year back in India, and the various travels--so roughly I have lived in SF for about six years..</p>
  <p>Having lived here for so long, I feel like I get a little nervous when I have to venture in the burbs; today we drove to Calistoga(Napa Valley), for my husband's cricket match, and I hated it...though my husband did pretty well, made 89 runs, and got a really expensive bottle of wine for being the MVP, I spent my afternoons, with are little one strolling the downtown Calistoga...and I hated it...have I said that enough, I could not wait to get back to the city</p>
  <h3>I am a city bum--do NOT take me to the wildrness</h3>
  <p>Yes, I love living in the city(it is in my DNA--growing up in MUMBAI), I think I even look like I am out of place. Today while strolling downtown Calistoga, I met a bunch of bicyclists, started chatting, first question they asked me was, Are you from San Francisco?, I looked at them, and was like how did you know...</p>
  <p>They were like, you look like from San Francisco. That left me wondering do people in SF look different?</p>
  <p>..And the answer is <strong>YES</strong>, apart from the urban wear that differentiates us, we have a certain aloofness about us, I think living in a big city, to some extent makes you skeptical and weary about people. We in SF are all to some extend jaded by living here...</p>
  <p>Honestly, I don't mind it, the weariness, and alofness; I quite like it, therefore places where people are overtly friendly, sought-kinda scares me, Calistoga scared me...couple weekes back we drove to Larkspur, for a cricket match also, same thing happened, strolling downtown Larkspur, bumping into locals, super friendly--wanted to have a conversation. I was polite, but inside I was yelling--get me back to SF, to snobbish nonchalant hipsters--</p>
  <h4>Moving out?</h4>
  <p>Deep down I know, the day is coming when I will have to leave the city, where will we move? we have been thinking Oakland?, but Oakland makes me sad, the gentrification and displacement, I really don't want to be part of that. There is also the talk of moving to LA, which to me is what I want to do next, last winter we spent a lot of time in LA, and <strong>I LUV LA</strong>, I can live there, it reminds me of Mumbai, it has all the crazinesss, and chaos that I so crave...and hipsters also(not that I will miss them)...So in the next coming months, after HR is over, and I apply for jobs, LA would be my top choice...</p>
