  <h4>Lesson 2: HTML/CSS/JQUERY-way too much to learn</h4>
  <p>
   One of the other assignments we had in the pre course work was to build a Twitter clone, which displayed user tweets, in reverse chronological order, and we were also asked to display single user tweets. Here is what I created</p>
   ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/TwittlerMain.png)
   ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/TwitterUser.png)
   
  </p>
  <p>
   While I was creating this, I realized how little I know about HTML/CSS...this was my first time using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and I have to say this does make your life easier. Instead of struggling and tinkering with CSS to set element properties uniformly, bootstrap does the job, and makes it look easy
  </p>
  <p>I think with this project I have barely scartched the surface, I plan to go back and re-read the modul on HTML/CSS...so for now that is all I am saying!</p>
