  <h3>Making Tiny Bio-Computers</h3>
  <p>Imagine:  When new DNA strands are added to the test tube as “input” the solution undergoes a cascade of chemical interactions to release different DNA strands as “output.” In theory, the input could be a molecular indicator of a disease, and the output could
be an appropriate therapeutic molecule. Well, it seems that these DNA-base circuits have become a reality<br></p>
  <p>A bunch of researchers at CalTech  have been sucessful in building a DNA based circuit that could play a simple memory
game. A circuit with memory could, if integrated into living cells,recognize and treat complex diseases based on a series of biological clues. </p>
<h3>DNA Strand Displacement</h3>
  <p>One of the exciting things that has come out of biocomputing, is DNA Strand Displacement. The DNA molecule, due to it's double standed nature, is the perfect candidate for Strand Displacement. DNA nanotechnology chiefly relies on single-stranded molecules that are relatively short (typically less than 100 nucleotides in length). Such “oligonucleotides” of arbitrary sequence can be synthesized chemically and bought from a variety of synthesis companies; in contrast, biological DNA — the carrier of genetic information — mostly occurs as a double-stranded molecule that can be millions of base pairs in length. The use of DNA as an engineering material has been additionally facilitated by the rapidly decreasing cost of oligonucleotide preparation and purification</p>
  <p>Strand Displacemnt occurs in a series of steps, where two stands either fully or partially hybridize, in the process displacing previously hybridized strands. This process requires multiple functional domains. The strand reaction is initiated by a short domain of one strand interacting with the domain of another, for example like A and A* on two seperate strands interact with each other. that leads to A*B*C* binding to the short domain, in the process displacing B*C*D*E*, where the B* on the two strands are competing for the attnetion of that long domain B..this whole process releases single functional nucleic product</p> 
  <p>Cascades of strand displacement reactions have been used to experimentally implement feed-forward digital logic circuits capable of combinational logic</p>
  <p>Lot of paralles can be drawn between such DNA circuits, and electronic circuits. DNA strand displacement circuits, for example do not have the spatial isolation of electronic circuits. DNA diffuses freely in solution. One way to ovecome this could be to design sequences with unique regions, that can each be situated at their own inividual gate.</p>
  <p>One way as proposed by Muscat et. al. at University of Washington is to have DNA circuits that behave like real circuits, with AND/OR gates, to restrict their interaction to components closet to them. Say when a component is activate, it only interacts with a coponent closest to it, this minimizes crosstalk. This lowers code pressure, and that means same signals can be used in multiple location, without the fear of crosstalk. A diagnostic circuit like this could be easier to deliver into the cells, when co-localized with cellualr components, and hence reducing fear of cellular degradation</p>
